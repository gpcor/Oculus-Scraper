* Occulus Scraper

Scraper to check availability of Occulus Rift S

Checks page availability, then lets the user know if the item is available or not. If so, it plays the mp3 file in the resources folder.

We used this as a bot in my friend groups discord to inform my brother when the Rift S was available on the Oculus site and, once it was, ping him every 10 seconds to inform him that he should go buy it.
